Everyday I see people in the gym that could clearly be a personal trainer. The only problem is they don't have the time, or money to get certified to become a trainer. Flex solves this problem by giving the individual the freedom to call themselves a trainer. Personal trainers can sign up and make a profile for a small subscription cost of $22.99 a month. This allows the trainer to have access to thousands of members who are looking for a trainer to help them achieve their goals. Flex also gives the members themselves the option of having multiple trainers for different workouts. We give the members the freedom to choose a different personal trainer for every day of the week if they would like. This is a win-win situation for all parties as the trainer makes money and the member saves money.
